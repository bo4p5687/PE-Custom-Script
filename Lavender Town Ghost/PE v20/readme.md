Take `graphics` in `PE v19`

Put files of `Script` in `\Plugins\Lavender Town Ghosts`

# How to use

Change or add new map id, find `GHOST_MAPS` in file `1 - Script.rb`.

Example: `GHOSTMAPS = [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 66]`

`50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 66` mean `map id`

If you fight `wild pokemon` and you don't have item `Silph Scope`, you will fight with `Ghost`.
