This script creates event: `Sky battle / Inverse battle`.
Put script in `Sky Battles + Inverse Battles.rar` in `\Plugins\Sky Battles + Inverse Battles`
Call script:
+ Set inverse battles, call: `setBattleRule("inverseBattle")`
+ Set sky battles, call: `setBattleRule("skyBattle")`

Read the first lines in file .rb for using. Thank you!
